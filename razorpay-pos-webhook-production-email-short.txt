Subject: Request to Update POS Webhook URL in Production - Ticket #17942295

Dear Priya,

Thank you for your support with the demo environment webhook configuration. The test environment is working perfectly.

We are now ready for production and need to configure the POS webhook in the **Live/Production environment**.

**REQUEST:**
Please update the POS webhook URL in production to:
https://api.samedaysolution.in/api/razorpay/notification

**CONFIRMATION NEEDED:**
1. Webhook URL updated in production environment
2. Test transaction sent to verify connectivity
3. Webhook secret (if different from demo)
4. Confirmation when change is complete

**STATUS:**
- Production endpoint is configured and ready
- SSL certificate is valid
- Endpoint supports both POS and standard Razorpay webhook formats

We are planning to go live within the next few days. Please let us know the expected timeline.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
