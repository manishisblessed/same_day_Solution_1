Subject: Update Required: Razorpay POS Webhook URL Change

Dear Razorpay Support Team,

Thank you for configuring the webhook for our demo environment.

We need to update the webhook notification URL:

CURRENT: https://www.samedaysolution.in/api/razorpay/notification
NEW:     https://api.samedaysolution.in/api/razorpay/notification

REASON: The current URL points to our frontend (static hosting), while the new URL points to our backend API server where webhook processing and database connections are configured.

The new endpoint is ready and tested. Please update the webhook URL and send a test notification to verify.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Same Day Solution Pvt. Ltd.
