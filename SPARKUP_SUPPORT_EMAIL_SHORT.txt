Subject: URGENT: 504 Gateway Timeout on payRequest Endpoint - Partner ID 240054

Dear Sparkup Support Team,

We are experiencing a critical issue with the BBPS payRequest API endpoint that is preventing us from processing bill payments. We have attached our Postman collection (BBPS_API_Postman_Collection.json) for your reference and testing.

ISSUE SUMMARY:
- fetchBill endpoint works perfectly (returns reqId and bill details)
- payRequest endpoint consistently returns 504 Gateway Timeout
- This occurs even with amount "1" (proving it's NOT amount-related)
- Response: HTML error page from nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)

TEST EVIDENCE:
Latest fetchBill Response (Working):
- reqId: EF17AKDJKHN1LJE9LMJHEPG3BC460311510
- Bill Amount: ₹29,899,958
- Status: Success (200)

payRequest Response (Failing):
- Amount tested: "1" (smallest possible)
- Status: 504 Gateway Timeout
- Error: nginx gateway timeout waiting for backend response

REQUEST DETAILS:
Endpoint: POST https://api.sparkuptech.in/api/ba/bbps/payRequest
Partner ID: 240054
Biller ID: ICIC00000NATSI
Biller Name: ICICI Credit Card

QUESTIONS:
1. Is the payRequest endpoint currently experiencing issues?
2. What is the nginx timeout setting for /payRequest?
3. Is there a known issue with reqId validation taking too long?
4. Can you check server logs for reqId: EF17AKDJKHN1LJE9LMJHEPG3BC460311510?
5. Are there any backend service delays affecting payRequest?
