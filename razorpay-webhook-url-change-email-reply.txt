Subject: Re: Request to Update Razorpay POS Webhook Notification URL - Ticket #17942295

Dear Amirsohel,

Thank you for your response and for proceeding with the webhook URL update. We appreciate your prompt action.

Regarding your questions:

IP WHITELISTING:
No IP whitelisting is required. The webhook endpoint at https://api.samedaysolution.in/api/razorpay/notification is publicly accessible and accepts requests from any IP address. This is the standard configuration for webhook endpoints, as Razorpay servers may send notifications from various IP addresses.

SSL CERTIFICATE:
The SSL/TLS certificate is properly configured and active on api.samedaysolution.in. The domain has a valid certificate installed, and HTTPS is fully operational. You can verify this by accessing the URL directly - it should show a valid SSL connection.

CONFIRMATION:
- Webhook endpoint URL: https://api.samedaysolution.in/api/razorpay/notification
- IP whitelisting: Not required (publicly accessible endpoint)
- SSL certificate: Valid and active
- Endpoint status: Ready to receive webhook notifications

We look forward to receiving confirmation once the webhook URL has been updated in your system. Please proceed with the update and send a test notification when ready.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
Manish Kumar Shah
