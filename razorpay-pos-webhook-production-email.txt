Subject: Request to Update Razorpay POS Webhook URL in Production Environment - Ticket #17942295

Dear Priya,

Thank you for your excellent support in configuring the POS webhook for our demo/test environment. The webhook is working perfectly, and we can confirm that all test transactions are being received and processed successfully.

We are now ready to move to production and need to configure the POS webhook URL in the **Live/Production environment**.

**PRODUCTION WEBHOOK CONFIGURATION REQUEST:**

**Environment:** Live/Production
**Webhook URL:** https://api.samedaysolution.in/api/razorpay/notification

**CURRENT STATUS:**
- ✅ Demo/Test environment webhook is configured and tested successfully
- ✅ Production webhook endpoint is fully configured and ready
- ✅ SSL certificate is valid and active on api.samedaysolution.in
- ✅ Database integration is complete and operational
- ✅ Webhook endpoint successfully handles both POS notifications and standard Razorpay webhooks

**REQUEST:**
Please update the POS webhook notification URL in the **Production/Live environment** to:
https://api.samedaysolution.in/api/razorpay/notification

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:**
- IP whitelisting: Not required (endpoint is publicly accessible)
- SSL certificate: Valid and active
- Endpoint status: Ready to receive production webhook notifications
- Webhook format: Supports both POS notification format and standard Razorpay webhook format

**VERIFICATION REQUEST:**
We would appreciate it if you could:
1. Update the webhook URL in the production environment configuration
2. Send a test transaction notification to verify the production endpoint connectivity
3. Confirm the webhook secret (if different from the demo environment)
4. Confirm once the change is complete and production webhooks are active

**TIMELINE:**
We are planning to go live with POS transactions within the next few days. Please let us know the expected timeline for this update.

Please let us know if you need any additional information or have any questions.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
Manish Kumar Shah
